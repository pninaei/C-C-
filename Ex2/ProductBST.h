/**
 * This function adds product to the BST with a lexicographic order of the
 * Products names.
 * It is the responsibility of this function to allocate memory for new node
 * and for name's string.
 * You cannot assume that the name isn't already in the tree.
 * You cannot assume that the quantity is positive.
 * Hint - Consider using a recursive helper function.
 * @param root : pointer to the root node of the BST.
 * @param name : string containing product's name
 * @param quantity : integer representing the existing quantity from
 * this product.
 * @return pointer to the root node of BST after adding a new product.
 * In case of memory allocation failure - return NULL.
 * In case of invalid quantity (zero or negative) - print error massage to
 * stderr and return the original tree, means - without adding the product.

/**
 * This function reads line after line from the file and
 * builds binary search tree. Each node at the BST represents different
 * product and contains its quantity. The order relation between the products
 * is according to a lexicographic order of the products names.
 * Hint - consider using the function add_product as a helper function.
 * @param filename : name of text file that contains names of products and
 * theirs quantities.
 * @return pointer to the root node of the BST, or null in case of memory
 * allocation failure.

/**
 * Given a binary search tree (root) and a name of product, this function
 * deletes the node with this name and returns root of the updated tree.
 * In case the name does not exists at the tree, the function will return the
 * root as is, and will print error massage to stderr.
 * Hint - consider the three cases of the node to be deleted:
 * 1) Node is a leaf (has no children): Simply remove the leaf from the tree.
 * 2) Node has only one child: The node of the child of the node to be deleted
 * is now father's child (more can be found at the PDF).
 * 3) Node has two children: Find inorder successor of the node. Copy
 * contents of the inorder successor to the node and delete the inorder
 * successor.
 * (Don't forget freeing old memory and allocating a new one validly.)
 * @param root : pointer to root node
 * @param name : string with name of product to be deleted
 * @return pointer to the updated BST root after deleting.
 * In case that input root is null, the function will return null.
